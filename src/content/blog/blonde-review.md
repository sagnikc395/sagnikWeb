Blonde feels like the music is deeply personal and accepting. It tells the story of forgiveness and acceptance and when we ask people about it - it like asking about i like that album to omg my heart is getting ripped out of the chest.

#### it feels like growing up

it feels like the first time you catch feelings for someone and instead of childhood infatuation , you can understand who they are, and then you realize that you could be better off without someone in your life.

#### love is inseparable from pain

The music feels that love is inseparable from pain and that's the beauty behind it. It brings about the sadness in the forefront and shares the same pain and love when you are in love.

#### it doesn't make sense at first

guaranteed that pink+white and white ferrai have sick music and the music makes you dance a little on the side walk, but it has different layers that makes you understand the depth as you slowly start peeling away from the different layers that you see.

the lyrics feel clearly personal but you don't actually know what he is actually talking about.

#### when i was down and terrible , this album helped me feel better

there is no reason why this is , maybe this is due to the fact that we all have been through that stage and frank's words + music just hits the right spot and makes us feel good and how it wraps around your life and you start to make memories around it.

#### in this constantly changing world this is your anchor
